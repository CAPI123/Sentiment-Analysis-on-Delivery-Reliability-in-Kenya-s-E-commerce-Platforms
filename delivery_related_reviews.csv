Glovo,"After the latest update, it became impossible to choose the location. It doesn't find the current address, in addition to that, it's impossible to search the address in the input box, because the keyboard just not responding (can't type anything). This literally breaks the entire app. Did you replace all developers by vibe coders, or what's the problem?",1,2025-07-21 09:47:42
Glovo,unhelpful & scammers use Uber eats instead. They used their own courier that never came and lied that the food was delivered wen I was not and waited 3h for them.

Glovo,"THREE hours I was waiting for an order that never came. Support was unhelpful, saying it was their highest priority but each time it would be delayed more and more. After three hours of waiting I gave up, asked to cancel it and they offered nothing. No discount or coupon for the troubles. They blamed it on lack of drivers due to regulations/laws causing troubles hiring new drivers. Cancelled prime immediately after this.",1,2025-07-19 10:50:35
Glovo,"‚ö†Ô∏è Scam.. made a transfer for an order, didn't get the order, haven't still gotten a refund.

Guess we run different calenders as its almost two months.. If you must work with them; use pay with cash (on delivery), don't transfer without receiving your order",1,2025-07-19 02:47:49

The drivers are among the most ridiculous people I ever had to deal with in my life (not exaggerating). I have a whole book of stories to share about my experience with them. If you ever see this comment, know that chances are about 50/50 if you will get the food delivered. Delivery times - don't ask. And then you have about 50/50 if the food will be warm.

Glovo,Total disappointment. Order delayed by an hour. Lack of delivery couriers.

So long...,1,2025-07-16 06:35:28

Glovo,"Ordered ‚Ç¨30 worth of food. Waited more than an hour, then I tried to talk to support. Order was marked as delivered but I never got it. When I finally talked to support they escalated into a specialized team that said they wouldn't refund it.

One third of these items never arrived (~40 euros).

Glovo,1 star because: 1. I pay for Glovo Prime and I'm being shoved ads I pretty much all screens. I think this is the only app I have with ads. Crazy that I have premium and still get ads. 2.

SCAM ELEMENTS! so i have been using Glovo almost Daily in 3 years, i always pay for prime subscription. lately i notice when i tipping and choose the 5% , often it counts it as 10% , be aware of this when ordering. not enough with that, now you have to pay a bad weather fee 3 euros! and it's not even bad weather! no Rain no nothing. also be aware even with prime, the same orders, the app pretend you dont have prime subscription and trying to charge you for delivery. lot of scam elements",1,2025-04-20 10:18:14

Glovo,"1. Support doesn't respond. When a store overcharges you, you're on your own. 2. Product names aren't translated in most places in the app UI, which makes it impossible to navigate and read receipts, previous orders, etc.",1,2025-04-20 02:27:31
Glovo,"Worst food delivery app. 0/5. Expect double charges (cash and food cards money) and very bad customer support service. The time for delivery is almost always false and/ or changing (e.g. 20:30-20:40 estimated time for food to arrive changes in-app, after a few minutes it will display 20:50-21:00). Small items (sodas, sauces etc.) missing often. Not recommanding this app.",1,2025-04-19 17:45:41
Glovo,"There should be no contact delivery option. Also, when i order items from grocery store, they do not inform me if they out of stock for some items... This app should get better and make some progress. It didnt change for years.",2,2025-04-19 08:48:10

Glovo,"Terrible experience trying to sign up I just opened an account and wanted to use the app, but I was shocked to find that the United Arab Emirates is missing from the list of country codes when adding a mobile number. This makes it impossible to register and place an order. How can such a large company forget to include one of the most well-known countries in the world? Every other country is there, even tiny ones, but not the UAE. Because of this, I‚Äôve been using your competitor BOLT!!",1,2025-04-18 12:20:48

Glovo,"A rider left with my food and claimed it was delivered. Meanwhile, he never reached out to me, either on call or WhatsApp. I contacted 3 different agents to reach him to bring back my food, but he refused. and demanded that I paid him extra for him to come back after we could reach him, but still didn't show up. no agent could convince him to come back and deliver the meal. and they don't see any wrong with the rider but expect me to pay for the meal i didn't receive. why didn't rider reachout?.",3,2025-04-18 10:54:11

Glovo,"Disappointing... You cannot cancel an order, even if placed 2 minutes ago, although the delivery time says 60-90 minutes.

Glovo,"Unfortunately, for more than four hours now Glovo has been reassigning my order to couriers that never picked up the order. Now, five hours since I placed the order, the store is closed. But the order is still being assigned to couriers.

Next day they are refunding that amount and withdraw a bigger amount, because they decided that the weather was actually bad at the time I ordered that order ( Not before an order or while I was ordering, day after).

Glovo,"I am home with my bedridden wife and a toddler working full time, so I had to ignore that small things were missing, delivery took hours etc. The worst customer service is what really topped it. I have reported that half of my delivery that took 3 hours was missing, making much of the rest of it unusable as well. It took 2 days to offer a refund and still refused to refund my subscription that I have done for this specific undelivered order. Shamelss thieves.",1,2025-04-10 03:22:37

Glovo,"For the love of God and all you know, don't use this app. Not only did they not deliver but they had the audacity to notify the delivery had been canceled way past the delivery time indicated. You are better off raising your own cattle, growing your own vegetables, and opening your own bakery to make bread, than you are to get what you ordered.

Once they deliver, after you already eaten something else, they charge you full price for uneatable cold food.",1,2025-03-19 00:48:48

Avoid unless you enjoy being disappointed and starving. **Rating: ‚≠ê (if I could give less, I would)**",1,2025-03-17 15:54:03

Given the dramatic amount of bugs in the app, I have very little faith in what they told me, which was that it was fraudulent behaviour. It's a bug.

But the Delivery guy who called said they made a mistake and he's gonna bring me a smaller order. But at least they offered me a 5 MAD Promo code So generous. If we cancel they force you to pay no matter what. This is a clear Client Mistreatment. I'm still hungry, No dinner today. If I could sue you I would. But I'm never using you again.",1,2025-02-15 20:11:34
Glovo,Good app very timely,5,2025-02-15 13:31:33
Glovo,"Absolutely unhelpful in the event of a mistake made when making an order. Essentially they made off with my money. The wrong location was set for an order, and they offered NO HELP whatsoever. It was either I lost the money or the order be delivered to said wrong location. Terrible!!!!!",1,2025-02-15 09:11:38
Glovo,Worst delivery app,1,2025-02-14 13:56:06
Glovo,"Horrible Customer Service. If your order is late, very late, there is literally no way to cancel the order without paying for the entire order. When you attempt to contact customer support, literally no one answers. So, if your order tales 3 hours, you cannot cancel it and no one in customer support will respond. Just take the money and toss it out the window",1,2025-02-14 12:44:47
Glovo,Late deliveries,1,2025-02-14 12:40:11
Glovo,"Delivery time, 100% accuracy.",5,2025-02-14 11:56:07
Glovo,"I placed an order, and it was successfully accepted. After 30-40 minutes, I received a message saying the restaurant had prepared the order and it was waiting for the delivery driver. However, after 2.5 hours, I still hadn't received my order, and it was eventually canceled. While waiting, I reached out to customer support for assistance, and they assured me that the delivery was coming soon. In the end, the order was canceled, and when I contacted support, they sent me a standard sorry message",1,2025-02-14 11:10:54
Glovo,Worsttttt app..2times 1st my order was dlvered to other house without confirming the rider jst give it. 2nd my drinks didnot came i will never use glovo again.costomer service is so poor. Not replying,1,2025-02-14 10:50:40
Glovo,"First order done in advance one day for Valentines day - canceled from Glovo 10 minutes before end of scheduled delivery time. And just refund and that's all, not even apology. Can not contact anyone. So no support, just pure random and luck. HORRIBLE.",1,2025-02-14 05:37:34
Glovo,Extremely Super and Excellent delivery with quality and quantity food . l love it,5,2025-02-14 03:24:16
Glovo,I shouldn't have to wait more than double the time because my orders are pooled by one driver. There should be a limit on the amount of orders one rider can pick up!,2,2025-02-13 09:07:34
Glovo,"I don't recommend this service. If products are missing, you don't get refund, you get app credits. In my case i used the credits with extra money, the order never reached me, but it was marked as delivered. I was never refunded and support only gives default answer.",1,2025-02-13 08:31:23
Glovo,"E ok, odata am comandat cu adresa mea si a fost mancarea lifrata la catedrala, nu am mers sa o iau si is obligat sa platesc 60 de lei in plus :(",2,2025-02-12 02:45:21

Glovo,Crashing when I try to view restaurants since the latest update,4,2025-02-10 19:21:10
Glovo,"Since it is not possible to contact customer support except for the automatic option through the app, the complaint and refund system unilaterally decides to refund 4.50 for something that was charged 8.50 and not delivered and considers it closed, more precisely, there is no option to disagree with what the app determines to be the solution to the complain. No option to 'not accept' a refund or god forbid you return the money and not the voucher for the app. or to deliver what was ordererd",1,2025-02-10 13:20:28

Glovo,Garbage app. Scammed - ordered food that was never delivered and they charged me for it despite the restaurant even attempting to deliver.,1,2025-02-09 13:11:00
Glovo,"Terrible customer support, no accountability whatsoever. They just charged me 48 euros but delivered items for 25 euros. While I have the receipt, that proves everything, their customer support initially replies with a delay of 27 minutes, then sends a generic message saying they can't refund with no details. With all the proof, they are basically admitting to have stolen the money. This happened so many times, I lost count, but this was the last straw. Deleting the app, you should do the same.",1,2025-02-09 10:15:08
Glovo,great service delivery üíØ,5,2025-02-09 07:55:58
Glovo,"For a while if was ok. I deleted it when a courier that was supposed to deliver accepted the order but told me she won't get it. They taxed me. I told them that my order was not picked up. They did not refund my money saying : ""the courier arrived at your location"". Well she did but did not pick up my package. I was doing the courier thing. I deleted the app ever since. Will not install it again",1,2025-02-09 06:31:19
Glovo,"Romanian user experience: 8/10 orders made within a month failed. 2 of them had a waiting time of 4 hours to be delivered. One started at 19:20 and it was cancelled at 22:40 when store closed and I was talking with the support guys. Suppor will not help you with anything when it comes to delivery details, they are having the same info the app is giving you so if an order will be a failed experience and you catch on time, you better cancel the order, support can't help you at all. Use other apps",1,2025-02-09 05:04:16
Glovo,"The Glovo (Nigeria) riders are very rude, as if they were forced to work. very bad mannered",1,2025-02-09 04:52:00

Glovo,"Let down too many times. Time to leave. 75 minutes for local delivery, food was stone cold",1,2025-02-07 13:54:04
Glovo,"Progressively worse delivery experience. Delivery personnel that dont speak, local or the English language, vague fees, and now, a horrible system for dealing with more and more common issues with the orders. Instead of asking you to send another driver free of charge,Giving you credits for the missing or broken items, plus a small extra amount that doesn't cover the delivery if you want to re-order the missing item, forcing you to pay basically a whole new delivery fe",1,2025-02-07 11:40:25
Glovo,"I've been using app for years, paid thousands using it, it's clearly visible from my account. Today I had an awful experience. I've placed an order while traveling by train to get happy meals from Mac for kids, well ahead of time - 40 mins, while delivery time was 20-30 min in the app. Long story short - courier didn't make it on time, he was late for more then 20 mins. Train departed, and I was fully charged because of their delivery issues.",1,2025-02-07 09:18:40
Glovo,"Made my first order and it never arrived. Tried to contact glovo's help center but it turns out they don't actually have anyone working there. Just automated message after automated message. The restaurant itself couldn't help me cause glovo had taken the money. Eventually I managed to get my money back after a month and countless calls, emails (to which I only got automated responses) and pain when I escalated the claim through paypal. I hate these stupid ai automated responses.",1,2025-02-07 08:04:20
Glovo,"My experience: downloaded the app, McDonalds food order was delayed 1 hour (1.5 hours wait in total). Customer support said that if I cancelled the order, then I still would have to pay the full cost of the order. Customer support has their hands tied and we're unable to help. In the end, they cancelled the order at 1am after I asked 100 times to cancel it. I can finally go to bed... Terrible service.",1,2025-02-06 15:58:02
Glovo,"It was great before, but now is just terrible. Listings in stores are not accurate so there is always a problem if you pay by credit card, couriers do not speak Serbian nor English, the last one asked for more money (on already overcharged bill) and took even more than he asked because he didn't have change. There was not even a bill in the bags. Just horrible. I think this company is not what it was and i will switch to some other app. I do not recomend Glovo anymore.",1,2025-02-06 09:38:23
Glovo,got there on time,5,2025-02-06 02:48:11

Glovo,Delivery is working bad. They are late every time,1,2025-02-05 03:14:56
Glovo,"Food got to me cold because the drivers are allowed to make 10 deliveries at the same time, if possible.. At checkout the 10% tip is autoselected to take advantage of you not paying attention and actually pay the driver in their stead... Just put the delivery cost separately and cut this deception. You can only rate the restaurants and not the actual delivery guys which frankly are the whole point of this app. I didn't give one star because at least I got the food.",2,2025-02-05 03:04:50
Glovo,a very fast and reliable delivery service üëç,5,2025-02-04 23:59:36

Glovo,Nice to make orders online. There is a bunch of places with the really fast delivery (30 minutes and less). A lot of restaurants integrated. Usually support helps with the issues (but not always).,5,2025-02-04 05:51:22
Glovo,"Waiting over an hour for my order, once it was too late to order from any other app they decided to cancel my order. This app is garbage for over a year now, they've got no couriers, no support, if you need help you need to waste about 3 hours before you manage to actually speak to a person. Do yourself a favour and install any other delivery app, don't waste your time nor nerves.",1,2025-02-03 13:19:20
Glovo,Horrible application. It wont notify you if any of the item is out of stock. I just spent half an hour ordering and the only thing I needed was not delivered. And I paid full amount because everyone failed to inform me,1,2025-02-03 09:38:37
Glovo,why theres no delivery time when the courier arives. this might be the worst update,1,2025-02-03 05:06:37
Glovo,Glovo is the worst delivery app last year and this year,1,2025-02-03 02:07:43
Glovo,"Bad communication and customer service. Made an order in the afternoon for the evening, they unapologetically cancelled it within the delivery time range, when most restaurants closed already. Customer service basically said ""Eh that's life. Anyway, here's a coupon and goodbye""",1,2025-02-02 11:20:53
Glovo,"Worst food app ever!!! Today's experience is the most devastating for me amidst past disappointments. I had ordered jollof rice, and 1 whole hour later, rider calls to inform me there's no jollof and if I would like to opt for white rice! 1 hour later!!!! 1 hour waiting in hunger!!! I get disappointed almost every time i try to use glovo. I'm switching completely to chowdeck and never going back to Glovo. I'm deleting and never recommending to anyone",1,2025-02-02 08:45:34

Glovo,"Glovo is unreliable in Portugal! They deliver random items instead of what you ordered, with half always missing. Refunds are a nightmare‚Äîsupport ignores complaints, makes you repeat info, and drags things out. Took three chats just to get a refund! No idea how often I‚Äôve been shortchanged, assuming missing items would be refunded. They constantly deliver expired products. Bolt, Uber‚Äîsame story, but untill yesterday I felt like Glovo was at least the best if the worst.",1,2025-02-02 00:54:07
