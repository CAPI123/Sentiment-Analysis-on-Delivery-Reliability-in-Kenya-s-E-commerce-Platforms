# Sentiment Analysis on Delivery Reliability in Kenyaâ€™s E-commerce Platforms

This project analyzes delivery reliability and customer sentiment for major e-commerce platforms in Kenya: **Jumia**, **Kilimall**, and **Glovo**. It uses user reviews from the Google Play Store to extract insights about delivery experiences, common complaints, and suggestions for improvement.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Fetches recent reviews from the Google Play Store using `google-play-scraper`.
- **Filtering**: Isolates delivery-related reviews using relevant keywords.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies reviews as Positive, Neutral, or Negative using TextBlob.
- **Visualization**: Provides pie charts and bar plots to show sentiment distribution and review counts per platform.
- **Text Analysis**: Extracts common words, bigrams, and suggestion-oriented phrases from reviews.
- **Actionable Insights**: Highlights key areas for improvement for each platform.

## Project Structure

- `Sentiment Untitled-1.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing all code for data collection, processing, analysis, and visualization.
- `delivery_related_reviews.csv`: Exported CSV of filtered delivery-related reviews.

- Jupyter Notebook
- Packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy

  - nltk
  - scikit-learn
  - wordcloud
  - google-play-scraper

Install dependencies with:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn textblob nltk scikit-learn wordcloud google-play-scraper
```

## Usage
